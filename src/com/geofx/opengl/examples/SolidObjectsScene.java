		 * in a future tutorial, for now, just know that it's good practice to make objects either clockwise or 
		 * counterclockwise, but you shouldn't mix the two unless you have a reason to.
		 * 
		 * We start off by drawing the Front Face. Because all of the faces share the top point, we will make 
		 * this point red on all of the triangles. The color on the bottom two points of the triangles will alternate. 
		 * The front face will have a green left point and a blue right point. Then the triangle on the right side will 
		 * have a blue left point and a green right point. By alternating the bottom two colors on each face, we make 
		 * a common colored point at the bottom of each face.

		 * Notice how the remaining three faces are included inside the same glBegin(GL_TRIANGLES) and glEnd()

		 * three more points, it will assume another triangle needs to be drawn. If you were to put four points 
		 * instead of three, OpenGL would draw the first three and assume the fourth point is the start of a new triangle. 
		 * It would not draw a Quad. So make sure you don't add any extra points by accident.

	 * Now we'll draw the cube. It's made up of six quads. All of the quads are drawn in a counter clockwise order.

	 * and finally bottom right. When we draw the back face, it may seem as though we are drawing clockwise, 
	 * but you have to keep in mind that if we were behind the cube looking at the front of it, the left side 
	 * of the screen is actually the right side of the quad, and the right side of the screen would actually be 
	 * the left side of the quad.
	 * 
	 * Notice we move the cube a little further into the screen in this lesson. By doing this, the size of the 
	 * cube appears closer to the size of the pyramid. If you were to move it only 6 units into the screen, the 
	 * cube would appear much larger than the pyramid, and parts of it might get cut off by the sides of the 
	 * screen. You can play around with this setting, and see how moving the cube further into the screen makes it 
	 * appear smaller, and moving it closer makes it appear larger. The reason this happens is perspective. Objects 
	 * in the distance should appear smaller :)
